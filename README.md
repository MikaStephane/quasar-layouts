Experimenting with Quasar Layouts

Using Quasar v1-beta.

These are just layouts, no content. Pick a site a mimick it.

To add a new layout:
```
quasar new l layout-name
```

1) Add the new layout to the routes file.
2) Add an item to the context menu on the page to navigate to the new layout.
3) Have fun!

Don't forget to add coomponets you use to the `quasar.conf.js` file if they are not already there.

To build: `quasar dev`

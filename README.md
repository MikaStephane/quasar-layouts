Experimenting with Quasar Layouts

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c20b469d-3a6a-46af-8b56-0b6b120cfd99/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/reverent-volhard-4aed03/deploys)

Using Quasar v1-beta.

These are just layouts, no content. Pick a site and mimick it or build your own unique layout.

So that we don't get duplicates, use the [Issues](https://github.com/hawkeye64/quasar-layouts/issues) tab to specify which Layout you are doing. And, check Issues tab before starting a new one.

To add a new layout:
```
quasar new l layout-name
```

> Make sure you add the new layout to the routes file.

Don't forget to add componets you use to the `quasar.conf.js` file if they are not already there.

To build: `quasar dev`

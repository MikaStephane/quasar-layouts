Experimenting with Quasar Layouts

Using Quasar v1-beta.

These are just layouts, no content. Pick a site and mimick it.

So that we don't get duplicates, use the [Issues](https://github.com/hawkeye64/quasar-layouts/issues) tab to specify which Layout you are doing. And, check Issues tab before starting a new one.

To add a new layout:
```
quasar new l layout-name
```

> Make sure you add the new layout to the routes file.

Don't forget to add componets you use to the `quasar.conf.js` file if they are not already there.

To build: `quasar dev`

Currently done (add alpabetically):
- Google Photos
- Google Play
- Youtube

Experimenting with Quasar Layouts

Using Quasar v1-beta.

These are just layouts, no content. Pick a site and mimick it.

So that we don't get duplicates, use the [Issues](https://github.com/hawkeye64/quasar-layouts/issues) tab to specify which Layout you are doing. And, check Issues tab before starting a new one.

To add a new layout:
```
quasar new l layout-name
```

1) Add the new layout to the routes file.
2) Add an item to the context menu on the page to navigate to the new layout.
3) Have fun!

Don't forget to add componets you use to the `quasar.conf.js` file if they are not already there.

To build: `quasar dev`

Currently done (add alpabetically):
- Google Photos
- Google Play
- Youtube
